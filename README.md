# Churn-E2E-Mini-Project

### Assignment: Churn Prediction AWS

In this mini-project, you'll be building an end-to-end churn prediction model using AWS's SageMaker. Amazon SageMaker is a fully managed service that simplifies the process of building, training, and deploying machine learning models at scale. It's designed to make it easier for developers to build, train, and deploy machine learning models in a production environment.

#### Challenges

The project had some challenges being that the instructions were older than the current AWS, however, the project was completed and ran on AWS. 

Due to the extra cost associated with running this project, this repository is what will exist after 11/15's mentorship meeting.

The process as documented in the AWS article above contain outdated screens and processes. Here you will see the new AWS screen. For this project, I used all the defaults settings/spaces in order keep excess costs down. Once my space was created I opened a new Jupyter notebook.

From this point, I inserted the code as was provided in the AWS article. Work had to be done to correct outdated code and some shortcuts had to be taken in order to get the code working in new aws env.

Drilling into the output file to show that the outputs were saved according to the assingment.


### Code
In order to see all updates made to the code in order to complete the project: see [this file here](./Customer_Churn_Modeling.ipynb)

This will contain a saved version of the evidence of how I was able to run through SageMaker environment.
